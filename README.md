# Godot-PlayerPrefs
This program is designed to manage persistent data storage for a Godot 4.2 game, similar to the PlayerPrefs system in Unity. It leverages the FileAccess class to read and write data to a configuration file located in the user directory. This ensures that data is saved across sessions and can be accessed globally from any script within the project.
